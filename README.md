# pannellum-translation
A central place for translated user-facing strings for the panorama viewer library called [Pannellum](https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum).

[Pannellum](https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum) includes english strings by default which can be overwritten to create a localized experience for the user/s.

The actual file names holding the strings should conform to the **ISO 639-3 Codes** which can be looked up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes).

If you have a request for a translation, **only** open an issue **if it doesnt exist already!**

If you want to contribute:
1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a branch e.g. `add-german-translation`.
3. Create a JSON file with the correct **ISO 639-3 Code** e.g. `deu.json`.
4. Translate the strings.
5. Make a pull request.
6. Now your changes will be reviewed by native speakers to ensure quality.
7. If the quality is acceptable, your translation will be merged. Congratz.
